This project implements a custom string class in C++ from scratch, without using any standard libraries such as <string> or <cstring>. It is designed to mimic basic string operations while reinforcing understanding of dynamic memory management, object-oriented design, and operator overloading in C++.

The MyString class supports a range of common string operations including assignment, copy, comparison, concatenation, substring search, and replacement. All functionalities are built manually, offering insight into how high-level string behaviors can be implemented at the low level.

Features
Manual implementation of dynamic memory allocation

Support for common string operations (length, copy, compare, concatenate, etc.)

Operator overloading for =, ==, +, [] and more

Substring matching with support for custom search and replace

Test file with sample inputs and expected outputs

Output log provided for result verification

File Structure
MyString.h: Class definition and function declarations

MyString.cpp: Implementation of all class methods

Test.cpp: Contains a simple main() function for testing the class

log.txt: Sample output demonstrating the class functionality
